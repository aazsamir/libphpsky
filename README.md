# Libphpsky

Libphpsky is a PHP library designed to interact with the Bluesky decentralized social media protocol. All types are generated from the Bluesky protocol schema, along with queries and procedures, ensuring everything is statically typed.

> **Note:** This is not an official library and is not affiliated with Bluesky.

### Usage

The default implementation handles authorization out of the box by providing `ATPROTO_LOGIN` and `ATPROTO_PASSWORD` environment variables. If the session is stale, it will automatically refresh it.

```php
$resolveHandle = ResolveHandle::default();
$did = $resolveHandle->query('bsky.app')->did;

$getProfile = GetProfile::default();
$response = $getProfile->query($did);
```

On top of that, there is a meta client, which can be used to handle all possible endpoints.

```php
$client = new ATProtoMetaClient();
$resolved = $client->comAtprotoIdentityResolveHandle('bsky.app');
```

Libphpsky also supports `\Amp\Http\Client\HttpClient` from [`amphp/http-client`](https://github.com/amphp/http-client) package out of the box.

```php
$client = ATProtoClientBuilder::default()->useAsync(true)->build();
$getProfile = new GetProfile($client);
$actors = ['bsky.app', 'steampowered.com'];
$futures = [];

foreach ($actors as $actor) {
    $futures[] = \Amp\async(fn() => $this->getProfile->query($actor));
}

[$errors, $profiles] = \Amp\Future\awaitAll($futures);
```

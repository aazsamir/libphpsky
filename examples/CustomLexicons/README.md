# Custom Lexicons Example

In this example, we demonstrate how to use custom lexicons and use them.

In `lexicons/fm.teal.alpha` directory there are custom lexicons from [teal-fm/teal](https://github.com/teal-fm/teal/) project.

`fm-teal-listen.php` will generate new types from them, and we will listen to Jetstream for events with those types.

```bash
php ./examples/CustomLexicons/fm-teal-listen.php
```
